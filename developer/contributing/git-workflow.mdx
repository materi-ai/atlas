Use a workflow that keeps changes traceable and easy to revert.

If you’re touching both code and docs, keep them in the same PR so history remains coherent and a
revert doesn’t strand incorrect documentation.

## Branching

-   Create a short-lived branch per change.
-   Prefer feature branches that map to a single intent (bug fix, refactor, doc update).

## Commits

-   Make commits atomic (one logical change).
-   Include enough context to understand why the change exists.

If you’re making a multi-step change (contract → implementation → docs), consider a commit per step.

## Cross-service changes

If a PR touches multiple services:

-   Start from the contract (OpenAPI/proto/events) and drive implementation from that.
-   Include a short “impact summary” in the PR description listing:
    -   affected services
    -   contract changes (OpenAPI, events)
    -   migrations/ops changes (if any)

## Keeping specs and docs in sync

From `platform/atlas`:

-   Run `python3 scripts/sync_reference.py --check` before requesting review.
-   If the check fails, regenerate with `python3 scripts/sync_reference.py` and commit the outputs.
