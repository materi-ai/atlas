title: 'What is Materi'
description: 'A collaborative content platform with an event-driven backend'
---

Materi is an AI-native content management platform built for teams that need:

-   Real-time multi-user collaboration
-   Strong access controls and auditability
-   Integrations and automation

## How Materi is structured

-   **Workspaces**: the boundary for users, documents, and policy
-   **Documents**: collaborative units (created/edited/shared)
-   **Collaboration**: real-time editing (presence + concurrent operations)
-   **Events**: changes propagated across services (event-driven sync)

Materi is designed so collaboration feels immediate while the backend remains auditable and
operable. Permissions and workspace boundaries matter: access is enforced at the
workspace/document level, and changes propagate via well-defined integration surfaces.

## Where to go next

-   If you’re a new user: see [First Document](/customer/getting-started/first-document)
-   If you manage a team: see [Workspace Setup](/customer/getting-started/workspace-setup)
-   If you’re integrating: see [Developer Guide](/developer/introduction/overview)

## What to expect

-   Most workflows start by joining a workspace, then creating documents.
-   Sharing is permissioned; access issues are usually membership or roles.
-   Real-time collaboration depends on a stable network connection.
