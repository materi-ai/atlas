This guide is intentionally workflow-oriented and does not assume a specific UI layout. The goal
is to validate that creation, sharing, and real-time collaboration work end-to-end.

## Steps

1. In your workspace, create a new document.
2. Add a title and initial content.
3. Share the document with a teammate.
4. Confirm you can see edits update in real time.

Optional checks:

5. Add a second collaborator and confirm access control is enforced.
6. Close and reopen the document to confirm it persists and reloads.

## Expected outcome

-   You have at least one document in the workspace.
-   A teammate can access it (according to permissions) and collaborate.

## Troubleshooting

-   If a teammate can’t access the document, review workspace membership and document permissions.
-   If real-time updates do not appear, refresh and try again; if it persists, see [Troubleshooting](/customer/support/troubleshooting).
