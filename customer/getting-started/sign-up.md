This guide describes the minimum path to get into a workspace. Exact screens vary depending on
whether your organization uses email/password sign-in or SSO.

## Prerequisites

-   An email address you control
-   If your organization uses SSO, access to your SSO provider

## Steps

1. Navigate to the Materi signup flow.
2. Create an account (or sign in using your organization’s SSO if configured).
3. Confirm your email if prompted.
4. Join or create a workspace.

If you were invited by a teammate, you may land directly in an existing workspace rather than
creating a new one.

## Expected outcome

-   You can access Materi and land inside a workspace context.

## Troubleshooting

-   If you cannot sign in, check whether your organization requires SSO.
-   If you do not receive an email, check spam/quarantine and request another.
-   If you can sign in but don’t see your team’s workspace, confirm you accepted the correct invite.
